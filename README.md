# case-study-Product-Recall
A car company went to market with faulty cars and those cars are now being recalled.

## Dirty Dataset
The task is to filter all cars that have reported to have faulty components, faulty single items or reported the whole vehicle to be faulty. The unstructured data files are first transformed with Tidy and the time period, if the car is faulty and the specific Motor are specified. Those cleaned tables are then merged and used to pinpoint the vehicles location.

## Shiny.js
The shiny app was created where each car was pinpointed and the radius around Stuttgart is freely choosable by the user.
